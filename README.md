# ai-workout-trainer


Awesome resource to get started with free API access
https://github.com/cheahjs/free-llm-api-resources

* Thinking Groq right now 1440 requests per day seems decent for my use case



# Initial ideas 
* Front end to display generated workouts

* Prompt to give upper body, lower, core, etc. These can came from buttons in the app

* Motivational quote to accompany workout

* Prompt formatting for correct output
    * Agnetic framework to find videos and explain moves from youtube

* Gather knowledge base of workouts

* Host on NAS

* Built in rep counter

* Create mobile app

* Save / export / import workouts from previous sessions
    * Save to local backend database on NAS

* Have backlog of workouts to call to
    * Inject into prompt to help standardize workouts
    * This needs clarified. It all depends on how well the LLM performs without existing workouts to work off
    * The LLM might do well enough from just the knowledge base and itself

* High temperature for variability of workouts




* As a side note, this could also apply to BJJ
    * I want to drill guard passing today, what should I work on
    * Could use metadata for inside or outside passing
